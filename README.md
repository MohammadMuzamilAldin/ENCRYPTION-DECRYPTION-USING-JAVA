# Encryption-and-Decryption-Software
In today's scenario security of data is very big challenge in any communication. There is a possibility of data breach or cyber -attacks on the data during communication. The hackers may try to steal the data if it is not properly protected. Network Security is the most vital component in information security because it is responsible for securing all information passed through networked computers. Only one particular element underlies many of the security mechanisms in use Cryptographic techniques hence our focus is on this area Cryptography. Cryptography is an emerging technology, which is important for network security. Research on cryptography is still in its developing stages and a considerable research effort is still required for secured communication. A day to day use of cryptography in our life is increasing tremendously, this is because of necessity of our protecting data from unauthorized access. As the days are passing the old algorithms are not remaining so strong as cryptanalyst are familiar with them.

# Objective
Our main objective is to make sure that the data is safely encrypted so that it is secure  to any kind of cyber-attacks . The confidentiality and the integrity of data are needed to prevent eavesdroppers from accessing and using transmitted data.

In this, we try to show how the encryption and decryption actually takes place.

Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.

To encrypt more than a small amount of data, symmetric encryption is used. A symmetric key is used during both the encryption and decryption processes. To decrypt a particular piece of ciphertext, the key that was used to encrypt the data must be used.

The goal of every encryption algorithm is to make it as difficult as possible to decrypt the generated ciphertext without using the key. If a really good encryption algorithm is used, then there's no technique significantly better than methodically trying every possible key. For such an algorithm, the longer the key, the more difficult it is to decrypt a piece of ciphertext without possessing the key.

It's difficult to determine the quality of an encryption algorithm. Algorithms that look promising sometimes turn out to be very easy to break, given the proper attack. When selecting an encryption algorithm, it's a good idea to choose one that's been in use for several years, and has successfully resisted all attacks.

# Concepts of Java used:
### INHERITANCE

Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes; for example, the relationship between father and son. Inheritance in Java is a process of acquiring all the behaviours of a parent object.

### EXCEPTION

An exception is an error event that can happen during the execution of a program and disrupts its normal flow. Java provides a robust and object-oriented way to handle exception scenarios known as Java Exception Handling

### SWINGS

Java Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) widget toolkit that includes a rich set of widgets. It is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and includes several packages for developing rich desktop applications in Java. Swing includes built-in controls such as trees, image buttons, tabbed panes, sliders, toolbars, color choosers, tables, and text areas to display HTTP or rich text format (RTF). Swing components are written entirely in Java and thus are platform-independent.

# Conclusion
By using this software we have successfully encrypted and secured the data from any kind of cyber-attacks. We were successfully able to implement the concepts of Swings, Exceptions, Inheritance into our project. The conclusion of cryptography is that it is a powerful tool for secure communication, but it is not perfect. There are a number of ways to attack a cryptographic system, and new attacks are constantly being discovered. Cryptography is an important part of security, but it is not the only factor to consider.
